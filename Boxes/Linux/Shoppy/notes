You need to Web Enum the Subdomain to uncover more places to go on the system

	Had git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git The wordlists needed for the box

wfuzz -c -f webEnum.txt -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -u "http://shoppy.htb/" -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb"

the wfuzz takes a long time to run through all the entries; but http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/ is declared as an existing subdomain

http://mattermost.shoppy.htb/ -> Mattermost login page
We can use josh:remembermethisway to login the page

Upon searching, the deployMachine DM Jaeger is the boss/admin and has gifted us a login credential
