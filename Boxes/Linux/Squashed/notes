Port scan showed an SSH, HTTP, RPC, and NFS

enum on NFS showed we could pull
{
	Export list for 10.10.11.191:
	/home/ross    *
	/var/www/html *

}

using sudo mkdir /mnt/dirName we can add a new area for a mount point

using sudo mount /dev/sda1 <mnt folder location> we set the mount

using umount /dev/sda1 we unset it after each use


We cannot access the /var/www/html cause it can only be accessed via www-data
/home/ross can be searched but all we find is a .kdbx file that's version 4 -
	-> meaning keepass2john cannot be used because it doesnt support v4 cracking

gobuster didn't result in anything
