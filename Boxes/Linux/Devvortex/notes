There is a subdom at dev.devvortex.htb

On the subdom there is a login at /administrator
some kind of Joomla login page --> NOT SQL INJECTABLE

Inside the subdomain there is a lot of stuff to look through, gobuster returns a lot of 301 redirections

Joomla is running v4.2.6 ==> Hacktricks has info on how to enumerator the service

-- 4.2.6 Exploit Search --

Possibly using an admin account there may be room for some kind of php rce

https://github.com/p0dalirius/Joomla-webshell-plugin ==> We can download the .zip file and install this plugin inside the site
gaining us RCE

Now that we are on the box we can sniff around and REMEMBER we have a SQLDB credential!
Using this we can find Logans hash and crack it with JohnTheRipper

============================================
Logan can run sudo command on the box, the version of the binary we can execute is `apport-cli 2.20.11`
Kernel is not exploitable

sudo apport-cli -c /bin/echo less
We use the -c to give it a path to a binary on the box
then we use less to allow us to read the large output

Once we get through we are given choices, best thing todo is V to View
this is because when we go to view we are in some kind of strange area, possible whats called a pager
the terminal looks almost like VIM or VI, so there is a chance using !sh can allow us to escape and achieve a root shell

This trick works and we can now read root.txt!
