nmap shows just ports 22 & 80

gobuster showed a .git directory -> dump using ` git-dumper "http://pilgrimage.htb/.git/" ./website `

Looking at the source code, there is a vulnerabilty within the magick program.
┌──(ender㉿UnDefineCS)-[~/Documents/LinuxMachines/Pilgrimage/website]
└─$ ./magick -version
Version: ImageMagick 7.1.0-49 -> https://github.com/voidz0r/CVE-2022-44268

Since we have a file read ability, we can gather a list of areas to try enumerating from the source code:
	cat *.php | grep -i "/var" -> /var/db/pilgrimage the file type is unknown, but it never hurts to try
	
the python script we made if we use any byte decoding to try outputting readable text, the string becomes
corrupted

To get an accurate reading, we need to use cyber chefs FromHex module [REMOVE A LOT OF THE 0's BEFORE CYBER_CHEF]
