The website has a login that didnt patch the default credential
root:password

Going onto the website logged in as admin, there is a drop down
on Admin > Users > Select

We can view the details about users such as
lnorgaard@keeper.htb:Welcome2023! --> SSH Credential

When we dump out contents of a zip file on the box we find a .dmp file
and a keepass 2.x file, there is a CVE that lets us dump the masterpass
from the dmp: https://github.com/CMEPW/keepass-dump-masterkey

When we google one of the passcode possibilities we get rerouted to a danish
dish called rødgrød med fløde

rødgrød med fløde --> kdbx passcode
Rødgrød Med Fløde
Rødgrød med fløde

rodgrod med flode
Rodgrod Med Flode
Rodgrod med flode
Rodgrod med Flode

Using keepassxc to open the kdbx file, we see there is a post
showing some kind of puttykey, we need to convert this into an
ssh-key

To convert this ppk to an ssh key we need to:
    sudo apt-get install putty-tools
    puttygen *.ppk -O private-openssh -o [output file name]
    
Now we can ssh as root on the box!
